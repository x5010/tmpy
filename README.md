# Turing Machine Factorial Calculator

This Python program computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer using a simulated Turing machine with two tapes.

### Algorithm Overview

- The input number is represented on the first tape.
- The second tape serves as the output tape to compute the factorial.
- The algorithm iterates through each integer from 1 to the input number, multiplying the current factorial value on the output tape by the current integer.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `tm.py` file.
2. Run the program using Python.
3. Enter a non-negative integer when prompted.
4. The program will compute the factorial of the input number and display the result.

### Example

```bash
$ python3 tm.py
Enter a number for which you want to compute the factorial: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120
# tmpy
